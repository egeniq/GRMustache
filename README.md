How To
------

### 1. Download and add to your Xcode project

    $ git clone https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.git

- For MacOS development, add `include/GRMustache.h` and `lib/libGRMustache4-MacOS.a` to your project.
- For iOS development, add `include/GRMustache.h` and `lib/libGRMustache4-iOS.a` to your project.

GRMustache can target MacOS down to 10.6 Snow Leopard, and iOS down to version 3. However, APIs based on Objective-C blocks and NSURL are only available from iOS4.

Alternatively, you may use [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods): append `dependency 'GRMustache'` to your Podfile. In its current version, CocoaPods exposes private headers that you should not rely on, because future versions of GRMustache may change them, without notice, in an incompatible fashion. Make sure you only import `GRMustache.h`.

### 2. Import "GRMustache.h" and start rendering templates

```objc
#import "GRMustache.h"

// Renders "Hello Arthur!"
NSString *rendering = [GRMustacheTemplate renderObject:[Person personWithName:@"Arthur"]
                                            fromString:@"Hello {{name}}!"
                                                 error:NULL];

// Renders from a resource
NSString *rendering = [GRMustacheTemplate renderObject:[Person personWithName:@"Arthur"]
                                          fromResource:@"Profile"  // loads `Profile.mustache`
                                                bundle:nil
                                                 error:NULL];
```

FAQ
---

- **Q: How do I render array indexes?**
    
    A: Check [Guides/sample_code/indexes.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/sample_code/indexes.md)

- **Q: How do I format numbers and dates, or localize portions of templates, etc?**
    
    A: [Filters](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/filters.md) and [Mustache lambda sections](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/helpers.md) are your friends. *Filters* act on the data you provide to the template, and are typically a good match for formatting values. *Lambda sections* act directly on the template canvas, and can help you process a full portion of a template.

- **Q: Does GRMustache provide any layout facility?**
    
    A: No. But there is a [sample Xcode project](GRMustache/tree/master/Guides/sample_code/layout) that demonstrates how to do that.

- **Q: How do I render default values for missing keys?**

    A: This can be done by providing your template a delegate: check [Guides/delegate.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/delegate.md).

- **Q: I have a bunch of templates and partials that live in memory / a database / the cloud / wherever.**
    
    A: Check [Guides/template_repositories.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/template_repositories.md).

- **Q: What is this NSUndefinedKeyException stuff?**

    A: When GRMustache has to try several objects until it finds the one that provides a `{{key}}`, several NSUndefinedKeyException are raised and caught. Let us double guess you: it's likely that you wish Xcode would stop breaking on those exceptions. This use case is covered in [Guides/runtime/context_stack.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/runtime/context_stack.md).

- **Q: Why does GRMustache need JRSwizzle?**

    A: GRMustache will [swizzle](http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2010-01-29-method-replacement-for-fun-and-profit.html) the implementation of `valueForUndefinedKey:` in the NSObject and NSManagedObject classes when you invoke `[GRMustache preventNSUndefinedKeyExceptionAttack]`. This use case is covered in [Guides/runtime/context_stack.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/runtime/context_stack.md). The dreadful swizzling happens in [src/classes/GRMustacheNSUndefinedKeyExceptionGuard.m](GRMustache/blob/master/src/classes/GRMustacheNSUndefinedKeyExceptionGuard.m).


Contribution wish-list
----------------------

I wish somebody would review my non-native English, and clean up the guides, if you ask.
